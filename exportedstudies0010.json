At the end of the day, our lives should reflect these answers and we should also be able to verbalize them based on scripture. So here goes… God is our creator (Gen 1:27) and he created the world through Jesus Christ (Col 1:16). He does not need anything from you or me like false gods, rather, he looks to gift us eternal life and all that we need while living on earth. God is compassionate, merciful, kind, and a God of justice (Ex 34:6-7). He is available to his people and desires that all his people come to know him so that they do not perish (2 Pet 3:9). Knowing God isn’t like knowing where the mall is or just saying that he is a being up in Heaven. Knowing him is relational, that is why he sent his son to die for us all (John 3:16).

I firmly believe that we as Christians need to internalize the word of God. We must be intentional about making it a part of our DNA so that we cannot have outward behavior that reflects otherwise. Let’s work this backwards for a minute… from a biblical perspective, our outward behavior is controlled by our thoughts, feelings and emotions. This means that we act as we think and feel so when happy we show it outwardly and when not happy that shows outwardly also. Therefore, our soul, which is our thoughts, feelings and emotions, dictate our actions or outward behavior. So what influences our soul? I’m glad you asked. We are spirit, with a soul, housed in a body. Our spirit is what is changed by God when we accept Christ as our personal savior. We are literally  born again in spirit ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 Pet 1:23"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Salvation is another way to express ‘born again’ and in doing so our spirit will live for eternity in the presence of God. All that said, back to the main point of letting our lives show that we are saved or born again at all times, not just when we want to appear holy. The Apostle Matthew just said it here in chapter 3. The Apostle James says it in chapter 1. And the Apostle Paul says it many times like in Ephesians 4. God wants our lives to be a shining example, the light on a hill, to show the world who He is and what everyone has access to if they seek Him and let Him change them just as He did for you and me.

Ephesians 6 tells us that we are caught up in spiritual warfare which means that Satan knows some things that we do not and because of this he declares war on us. You see, if the enemy is attacking that means that he has peaked into your future of faith and service and sees what and how God plans to use you so he is literally trying  to destroy you before you can realize and accomplish what God has planned for you. It is just like when Pharoah killed all the babies because of fear and when King Herod killed all the babies because of a similar fear. They both knew that if the babies were allowed to grow and develop that they would likely destroy all they had built. And clearly that did happen through Moses and Jesus.

The same goes as we grow more and symbolically have a house of wood meaning our faith is improved, we are not practicing habitual sin but still there are things that keep us from reaching our spiritual potential because our prayer life is lacking and we are not studying the word regularly. God requires our all and our best all the time and He cannot fully give us all that He wants to until we give our all to Him beginning with faith and then exercising said faith in every aspect of our lives. That means complete submission in such a way that we know we can’t even take our next breath without the grace of God. So it begins with repentance which is the changing of our mind and going in the opposite direction. This is reliance on God rather than ourselves.

Then it becomes our job to protect it at all costs because our heart is our north star and guides us. Our heart ministers to our soul which are our thoughts, emotions, feelings so with a right heart we have right thoughts, emotions and feelings but the opposite is also true and with a wrong heart, we end up with darkness in our thought, emotions, and feelings.

I have a loved one who gives me reason to always say to her, “you are never happy unless you are mad at something.” My challenge for us is to dare to be free and to release bitterness. How? I am so glad you asked. It is a one word answer called…FORGIVE. Jesus taught us that way back when He taught us how to pray. He said when we pray, ask the following of God: “And forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 6:12"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").” That means we implore God to not count our sins against us ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Cor 5:18-19"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"), but notice the connective word ‘as’ which connects the second part of the verse which is telling God that we have forgiven those who have offended us. It is very much a two way street. God forgives us as we forgive others. Consider it a contract, joint venture or mutual agreement with the Lord. In order to get from God we must give to others. Verse 15 also speaks to the breach of contract reminding us that if we do not forgive others then our Heavenly Father will not forgive us. That is plain and simple. Again, why? Well while the concept of forgiveness is simple in concept, it is difficult in application. God wants us to forgive because of Jesus’ finished work on the cross that allowed Him to forgive us. And secondly, He knows that unforgiveness is a root that grows deep and is watered and fertilized by the enemy. Bitterness leads to all kinds of bad thinking which is the corruption of our soul and bad thinking leads to bad behavior which is usually unrepentant and self righteous. God cannot  use us the way He wants when we live a life of bitterness and sin. So he tells us to forgive as He has forgiven us ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Eph 4:32"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":") and He tells us to forgive often ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 18:21-22"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

It is important to realize that our decisions have both a journey or process as well as a destination or conclusion. Jesus points this out simply by use of His descriptions or adjectives. He uses narrow/small/wide/broad as juxtapositions to each other. He basically states that those who choose to follow the broad path where many fit and enter the wide gate where many enter will have a destructive conclusion. Think of those who choose to lie, cheat, steal, and do the immoral. Those things have a much easier journey or process and usually bring lots of joy and pleasure along the way, yet they end in destruction. By way of comparison those who choose the narrow small path and enter through the narrow gate often have challenges along the way like years in school, debt, long hours, less pay in the initial stages but they are building on solid rock which will sustain them when the rain comes ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 7:24-25"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

We all know His overall plan was to die for our sins and bring redemption, renewal and reconciliation to mankind. We also know that our job is to be on a mission of progressive sanctification which is to model our lives after Jesus as we try to become more like Him. Mark gives a great synopsis of a day in the life of Jesus. He came into town and went right to the synagogue and began teaching with authority; demonstrating that He Himself is the word of God and the fulfillment of the prophecies. People recognized this and were drawn to Him and the message. In the process, one of Satan’s demons accosted Him and Jesus drove Him away allowing the people to see His power. He  went on that same day to heal many who were afflicted with disease or demon, or injury. Then, very early the next morning, as was His custom, He retreated to pray, meditate and spend time with God who would  communicate with Him directly to restore Him physically, mentally, and spiritually. Jesus as God-Man needed this as it allowed Him to focus and stay on  mission. You and I can learn from this same one day experience of watching Jesus. We should prioritize doing God’s work right when we wake by asking God how we can use our gifts and talents to serve Him and others today. We should be grounded in the word because just like the demon accosted Jesus, the enemy is going to challenge us often times without warning and with our sword which is God’s word, we will be able to defeat Him ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Heb 4:12"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":") because with God’s word no weapon formed against us will prosper ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Isa 54:17"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"/"},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Rom 8:37"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Finally, everyday in our humanity, we need to return to our altar and submit our works of the day to the Lord and thank Him for using us while we also lay our praises and our burdens before him and then receive comfort, relief, guidance and encouragement to continue our walk.

Remember, He came to save the Jewish Nation and fulfill prophecy. However, led by the Pharisees, the jews of that time and still many today deny who He really is and reject His message and His mission.

Is it a financial crisis, a dysfunctional relationship, substance abuse, depression or something employment related? Whatever it is, please right now thank God for it and let’s use it to glorify the Lord. You see, sometimes God has to create or allow raging storms to penetrate our lives and put us in a position where we must first of all look for Him, turn towards Jerusalem metaphorically speaking, and then put us in a position of total dependence on Him. Then out of our repentance and need, God can give us healing and restore our soul and use our experiences to bless others and turn them towards Jerusalem. On a personal level, I went to prison for three years and spent time, lots of time with people who had done unspeakable things. Yet, because I chose to pursue all things God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, I saw Jerusalem and ran towards it where, along the way, God then met me and delivered me in such a way that He could then use my bad experiences to show people how good, kind, gracious, and merciful He is. As a result, people were saved and this website exists to shine a light for people to see who God is and be saved and walk with Him daily. How can you turn what is or has been seemingly bad or horrible in your life and let God use it to glorify Him and to show others how they can come to know God or be closer to Him. You see, God is sovereign and completely intentional about what He allows us to go through and He wants us now to be intentional about how we will use our storms to do His will and kingdom work. "},{"insert":"\n\n"},{"attributes":{"underline":true,"background":"transparent","color":"#000000","bold":true},"insert":"Prayer"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000","underline":true},"insert":":"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":" Thank you Father for the storms in our lives.

I promise you, it does not exist. Therefore, in the example above where Mary anointed Jesus with the best she had, It was because of her immense love and for Him reflecting her unselfishness and reverence for who Jesus was in her life.

Newscasters are famous for reporting in such a way as to proclaim that because they witnessed and experienced an event as it unfolded, their account is the most accurate that can be told. Well, such is the accounting of the Roman soldiers proclaiming that Jesus was the son of God. First off, let me give a brief outline of what a Roman soldier was as I cannot find a modern day equivalent. They were young, bold, pure in bloodline, physically fit, mentally tough and morally upright. In addition to being disciplined, educated and talented, their most reverent quality was their loyalty. They followed orders perfectly and without hesitation. Truly, they were modern day super soldiers. A company (100 soldiers) of them were assigned to Jesus at His trial, where they mocked Him, tortured Him, and ultimately carried out His crucifixion. This was nothing new as Rome ruled all of Europe and the entire world for the most part and soldiers killed for a living, but scripture says that upon the death of Jesus, things happened. The earth shook, the sky was black, things unmentioned happened to the point that it “terrified” these soldiers and had them do a 180^ turn mentally and morally and move from mocking and taunting to testifying that this most assuredly was Jesus, King of the Jews, and Son of God. So I ask, my friend, and hopefully it will not take a Roman soldier experience, what has happened or is happening in your life that will make you testify out front for all to see that Jesus is King and the Son of God? I submit that you and I have to practice and prepare just like a Roman soldier, train and be disciplined so that when we get the opportunity to share our faith, the receiver(s), will see our boldness, education, and training and then do a 180^ turn themselves and come to know our risen savior.

You see from time to time it is very important to take a step back and just be honest. What is there? What do we see? Can we truly say that we are obeying the word of God? It is a simple and straightforward question, yet when facing it head on, many of us shy away from a direct answer. Everyone wants some wiggle room to be interpretive and flexible with what the word is instructing. However, it is not there. Do we love our brothers and sisters in action always or only when they behave as we think they should ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 John 2:9"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

These are not questions that leave room for alternative interpretations or wiggle. Let’s approach it from the other side as again I promised to be encouraging. Through prayer and supplication which is submission and humility, are we able to say that we are constantly, daily, committed to do the following:  be a faithful friend and spouse; be tempered and self-controlled; be respectable and hospitable; remain sober and free from addictions of all kinds; be gentle and not combative physically or verbally; and not be influenced by things that look and feel good; and not be self-righteous in allowing your standards come from your own belief system entirely. God is calling us not just to say a prayer and take a dip in  the pool and then say we are done, see ya in heaven. Rather,  He is compelling us  to be intentional about this Christian journey and become more and more like Jesus ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Phil 3:10-14"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":") as we mature and grow in our faith.

There is nothing, literally nothing more important than sharing the gospel and our faith with another person. Lord willing, the Holy Spirit will connect with their spirit and they will come to know and accept Jesus as their personal savior and become saved. The nuances or little things or details, whichever way you want to consider it matter greatly. First of all, Phillip was obedient without question when told to go South by the angel. This is similar to Abraham who was also obedient when told to leave his home by God. Neither was given a destination but only a direction and the option to obey or not. They did. Next, he was a willing man in the sense that he met a man along the way and engaged him. That led to his opportunity to share his faith and understanding of the gospel as the man he encountered happened to be struggling to understand a passage of scripture he was reading which was "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Isaiah 53:7-8"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":". Upon explanation, the man wanted to become saved and baptized and Phillip answered the call without delay. You and I should be so available to another should God place them in our sphere of influence. The first thing we must be is obedient. Scripture calls us to be obedient as we come to know and understand God’s expectations ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Jam 1:22"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). We do this based on our faith because rarely will God give full picture details about his instructions, yet our faith and trust allows us to do as the Lord instructs. Next, we need to be willing. Think initially about Jonah who was unwilling to follow instructions and God used three days inside the belly of a fish to get his attention. God wants willing and obedient servants who are cheerful as we do His will ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Cor 9:7"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").  Speaking of… doing the will of God requires us to be equipped with certain tools and skills. The word and prayer  are accessible to every person of faith. We have to know it and understand it if we are ever going to share it with others. How often do you eat? Daily I assume in order to stay healthy and vibrant. The same is true with the word as it is alive and in concert with prayer, it will feed our spirit and soul all the while equipping us to live the Christian life ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Rom 12:1-2"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"/"},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Tim 2:15"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). We can also expect the things Jesus said we will need to endure like suffering, trials, tribulations which make us stronger in our faith and enhance our testimony in service of others ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 10:22"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"/"},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"John 15:18-20"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

I am sure that the disciples felt disillusioned after getting such a rebuke from Jesus. However, It leaves one to think about this thing, this entity, this construct called faith. How do we posit it, gain it, increase it, wrangle it, use it? Clearly it is at the top of the list of requirements to become a Christian and follower of Jesus and Jesus constantly through scripture uses it  as a litmus test to define our Christian walk. Yet, why does He not give direct, prima facie, instruction regarding faith? He merely identifies those who have it and exercise it or those who do not have it and criticizes them. What the heck, right? Well, I believe it is because everything about being a Christian and having a relationship with the Lord is about having faith and given that it is the standard, the bar must be set in such a way that every believer understands that faith is both a possession and a journey. Upon receiving the gift of salvation, we are all given a measure of faith ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Rom 12:3"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"), that’s our possession but we are expected to then embark on the journey to increase it, use it, and understand it as we work toward our God given purpose.

Drive in listening to my gospel and get ready for a great work day as a dedicated employee and Christ-like example for all who encounter me. Sounds like a good way to model a typical morning for a believer right? I agree but if we are not careful, sometimes life can happen, perhaps with some help from the enemy and we might get a bit more of this: up late binge watching my favorite show(s), maybe have a cocktail during the evening, sleep restlessly because of one thing or another. Suddenly 5am comes and I roll over deciding to skip exercise which also means I don’t hear my pastors bring the word. Postpone prayer, scripture and journal til after work because I am hustling due to sleeping in. Get to work fatigued and not be prepared or excited to be an example as I did not rest my body, fill up my  spirit and soul with the things that will allow me to represent the faith as I should. It happens and I get it. Let me also be clear that no sin was committed in the example above. However, the scripture tells us to throw off what hinders AND sin that entangles. You see the enemy is cunning and he is tactical in such a way as to try to erode our foundations through deceit like, “I can do it later” or “missing one time won’t matter.” He might discourage us by, “I haven’t done it lately so why bother.” and the ever powerful timely distraction like, “did you see that last episode? I had to keep going.” The point here is to remind us all that it is easy and human to get off track but the bigger message as the writer is suggesting, is to have a plan and be intentional regarding our walk with the Lord. We must be somewhat disciplined ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 Cor 9:24–27"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"), not robotic, but again focused on the things that keep us in line with how we spend time with God. We have to show up and be present. The word, prayer and praise are how we thrive each day as a Christian just as sleep, food, and water are how we maintain our physical body. No matter what, we find a way to eat, drink and sleep as these are non-negotiables for life. Therefore, we can also find time to read, pray and praise in a non-negotiable way.

There are no more racial hierarchies like between Jew and gentile back then and whites and blacks in our country today.

The theme is bread and how the bible uses it throughout as a metaphor for provision. When you think about it, probably over 90% of our prayers are asking God to do or provide. In short, we ask for provisions. And as I thought about it, I wanted to understand and help you understand what that really means and also convince you that God already does so much more than we realize. The other thing is that we need to understand and apply the understanding that provisions are always faith based.  Without faith, God cannot do for us all that He wants to. And because of faith, God does provide, which engenders increased faith and matures us as believers. Finally, as a mature believer, you must remember that God’s thoughts and plans are not the same as ours so be mindful that He will provide according to His will and His purpose and that is also how we need to pray. Below is a list of scriptures that I want you to tackle and become familiar with as they serve as a reminder for what God is already doing and they serve to let you know what you can expect from God because He has already done it for others. This will give you a bit of a road map as to how to petition God. "},{"insert":"\n\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000","bold":true},"insert":"Scripture\t\t"},{"insert":"\t\t\t\t"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000","bold":true},"insert":"Bread

To be clear, no one looks for suffering, trials or tribulations but scripture is clear that all will have them regardless of status. All of us will have to endure things that hurt be they physical, emotional, short term, long term, regular, or intermittent. It is upon us because of the original sin. However, God says that He will bring comfort. Jesus says He will give us His peace ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"John 14:27"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

Then when we are successful, we pass it on to others who experience similar circumstances. Now how do we define success and how do we pass it on? Success means that no matter what stage of discomfort we find ourselves in, we walk in faith and peace. When it looks like trouble is on the way - walk in faith and peace. When in the middle of trouble - walk in faith and peace. When trouble has finally passed - walk in faith and peace. We do this because suffering brings comfort as much as comfort brings comfort ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Cor 1:7"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). If we did not have trials and sufferings how would we ever know and experience the gifts of God? How would  we ever know true peace and how would we ever grow our faith. There is an old hymn called ‘Through it all’ that says, “In every situation, God gave me blessed consolation. My trials came to only make me strong.” It later reinforces the point I made earlier by saying, “If I never had a problem, I’d never know God could solve them, I’d never know what faith in God could do.” That’s a drop the mic saying if I have ever  heard one. Then we pass it on by how we live and how we thank God for the mountains and for the valleys because it just doesn’t matter which one we are in because God is there with us. We pass it on to our family and friends by sharing our struggles and our victories so they can see God in action. Let them see how you are the day you lose your job, or your spouse, or get cancer and then let them see how you are in the midst and how you are once God gets you through. And finally, pass it on to those who see  you but don’t know you by how you carry yourself and treat others no matter what the day brings. Let the light of Jesus shine through you without saying a word. They will recognize that something good, right and better is in you. Well that’s it and that’s all as we now have choices to make.

Yet, I do feel obligated to send a bit of a wake up call to believers as we are in such a polarizing and divisive time in our country. This chapter, which was written some 500 years before Christ walked the earth, shows us that the events and attitudes of today are not new or fresh. They have existed before and are here again. Therefore, I am suggesting that we look and see what God says and what He did and then follow the pattern so that we can have Godly outcomes. You see, as a Christian we do not get the luxury of saying and thinking on our own. Scripture is always challenging because it confronts our personal opinions. However, we are required to pursue a biblical worldview of literally everything we experience and ask God to align our hearts with His so that our thoughts and actions are according to His will and purpose. That’s the job, that’s the expectation. As an example, I submit these 6 topics which are very much “HOT TOPICS” today and yes there are more than this but I just use these for the sake of brevity. Reproductive rights, War, The Jew and Jewish nation, Government, Immigration, and Education of children are all topics that put people, yes Christians, in a very volatile state but unfortunately that volatile state is usually based on personal positions rather than that of a biblical worldview. Again, we must ask if God has already spoken about such things and the only way to know is to be a believer who eats the word daily as part of their daily meal plan ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Tim 3:15-17"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":") and get out of our own heads. Then we invest in spreading the truth in hopes that it will engender Godly righteousness and justice because the other side, Satan’s side, is a propaganda machine working against all this Jesus. Yes, absolutely, this will come at a cost to all believers and it should as God has already told us that living for Him will not be popular and we will be rejected by the mainstream. But we also rejoice because suffering for the Lord is a right and a privilege ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Acts 5:41-42"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Remember, we are foreigners here on earth and our rewards are stored in heaven ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 5:12"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"/"},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Phil 3:20"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Now back to the example to make my point clear and relevant. Here are just a couple of scriptures on these topics that each of us should seek as well as others because the word is deep and multi-layered. And then pray for God to show us His way and then act on it as we have opportunity. Personally, when I speak on such things I lead with, “Regarding ________, the Bible says _______” and then go from there so it is clear that I am an ambassador for the Lord and do not speak of my own volition ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Cor 5:20"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":")."},{"insert":"\n\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Reproductive rights: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Ps 139:13-14"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Jer 1:5"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"War: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Ecc 3:8"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 5:9"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"The Jews: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Gen 12:2-3"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Rom 11:1"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Government: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Rom 13:1"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 Pet 2:13-14"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Immigration: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Lev 19:34"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Matt 25:35"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Education of Children: "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Prov 1:7"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Deut 6:6-7"},{"insert":"\n\n"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"The final point of all this is to answer the question of “Why are we doing all this in the first place?” Well, it is because from Genesis to Revelation, God is a God of justice and requires the same of his people ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Mal 6:8"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":", "},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Isa 1:17"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

Can He, in turn, trust us? I suppose you heard the “Mic drop” just as I did and feel convicted of all that we do and allow against God’s will and guidance. If God calls, will we be drunk, or high, or asleep, or in the midst of sexual immorality or stealing or lying? Have I missed anything that we might actively and intentionally be doing against His precepts? I only mean to strongly suggest that we need a point of pure self-reflection and ponder whether or not God can trust us in the life we claim to live for Him. Do our lives reflect our faith?

It is very much a ‘me first ‘and sometimes a ‘me only’ culture that we live in. It is all about how a person can attain as much as they can for themselves based on their desires. If wealth - never stop earning; If fame - never stop influencing; If power - take it all… and so on. We have become obsessed with having more and then taking credit for whatever heights we obtain because we manifested it from within. Yuk, Gross, Nasty, Horrible is what Paul said as He proclaims that only what we do for Jesus matters. He laid out his own resume in saying that he was raised and believed in such a system initially and no one was more accomplished than he was, but when Jesus Himself met him in Damascus and revealed Himself, things changed forever and he realized that everything he had done was all garbage ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Phil 3:4-7"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Only his relationship with Jesus and pursuit of all things Jesus was relative and important. And the only thing that would get him there was faith in the Gospel which is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and nothing else of his own doing. My friend, we have to follow this example as Paul says in V:17 because the world and its culture are enemies of the cross. Some enemies do it outwardly and others disguise it with partial and false truths about what faith and the gospel really are and what they really mean and what they really do for the believer. I’m being radically true and honest when I say that we have to develop a new mindset with EVERYTHING and measure it by the standards of the cross ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"2 Cor 10:5"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). Then once our minds are right, our outward behavior needs to reflect the new mindset as Paul says in ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 Cor 2:2"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":") that everything is about Christ and His crucifixion. Even deeper is what he says in that when we become Christian, our old self literally dies; we then are literally crucified with Christ and reborn only with Jesus living in us ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"Gal 2:20"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":"). That’s both powerful and direct and does not leave wiggle room for where our Christian walk needs to be prioritized. So to conclude, the things we earn and do are not garbage—provided we credit it all to the glory of God. But when we live apart from that purpose, we risk losing sight of what truly matters.

We all love to be exalted and there is nothing wrong with that. We work, we study, we do our best job and the accompanying praise or acknowledgement feels great. It can be literally intoxicating at times.

But in order to live such a life, we clearly must clean up the areas that are not good or pleasing to God. That’s the really tough part because while this is super easy to understand with head knowledge. It is very difficult to apply with heart knowledge and then make changes. So what’s the key? I believe that it is both hate and faith. You see, consider the things in your life all placed in a cup which is always full. The cup can never be empty or partial as it contains all of you. Therefore, if you remove something from the cup, it must have a replacement. That is where hate and faith apply. Take a practical example: if I hate the way my body looks, I might choose to remove junk food and laziness and replace them with healthy food and exercise. But here’s the real question: how much do I actually hate what’s harming me? Because if I don’t hate it enough, I probably won’t commit to meaningful change. Then comes faith. As I make those better choices — eating right and exercising — I have faith that over time, those choices will change my body. I act in hope and expectation that the replacement will produce the result I desire. The same principle applies to our spiritual lives. Do we hate what God and Jesus hate enough to want to remove it from our lives — from our \"cup\" — and replace it with what pleases them? Do we care enough about our relationship with God to be honest about what needs to go? Do we trust that what He offers in return is better? Yes, God and Jesus do hate certain things. Scripture is clear about that. But in His love, God doesn’t just expose what’s wrong — He shows us what to replace it with.

How do we go about it? How do we go about our Christian walk? Well there is the vertical; meaning we are the branches and God is the vine. He pours into us so that we can grow and bear much fruit. Along with that Jesus reminds us that without following that exact process, we can bear no fruit at all and we will be faithfully useless ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"John 15:5"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

Please note the importance of order in that God’s love comes first then followed by His commands. And just as important, that flow never ends. We need to emulate this pattern in our lives with our family and others. We need to flow love into them first. They need to know that above all else, we love them. Remember earlier where I talked about Jesus loving us to the point of death? We need to keep that fact and feeling in front of our spouses, sons and daughters not based on their behavior but based on who they are because that is how God does it. No matter what we have done, God sees us for who we are. From there, it is possible to send commands but again, they come from a place of love and love is patient, kind, humble, peaceful, etc ("},{"attributes":{"background":"#ffff00","color":"#000000"},"insert":"1 Cor 13:4-8"},{"attributes":{"background":"transparent","color":"#000000"},"insert":").

We must acknowledge the truth, whatever it is, and repent as we change our mind and decide we want to move towards a right way of living and restore our relationship with God.

Who in your world has done wrong by all accounts and is in need of forgiveness? There surely will be someone or maybe  a few.
