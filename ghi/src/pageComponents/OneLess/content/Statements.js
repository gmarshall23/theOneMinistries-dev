    [<span>Spiritual Maturity Includes:</span>, <p></p>,  <p>Knowing - "waiting" time is not "wasted" time</p>, <p>Knowing - faith in God is NOT trust in God. **</p>],
    [<span>Without God's passion and purpose your Spiritual Gifts will lead down one of two roads. One of Pride (self righteousness) or One of Passivity (self loathing). **</span>],
    [<span>IF-THEN statements with God only work this way: "IF" God's word says it, "Then" it will be so. **</span>],
    [<span>Have IN-TI-MA-CY with God. It means: He-can-see-into-me because there can be no healing without revealing**</span>],
    [<span>God's blessings are not always rewards for past behavior but preparation for future tests</span>],

    [<span>When you truly trust God, you stop asking him for things and start thanking him for doing those things.</span>],

    [<span>My friend, You  need to "trust" the Power within  you more than "fear" the Power against you</span>],
    [<span>Listen carefully my friend, Can you hear Jesus whispering from inside or do you hear Satan screaming from the outside. (Jam 4:7)</span>],
    [<span>You can't hear the voice of God whispering to you because you are focused on Satan screaming at you</span>],

    <p>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</p>,
    <p>But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>,
    <p>... for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls...</p>,
    <p>For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord,"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</p>,
    <p>... Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>,
    <p>I can do all things through him who gives me strength.</p>,
    <p>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus...</p>,
    <p>... because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death</p>,
    <p>Let everything that has breath praise the Lord</p>,
    <p>Do not be misled: "Bad company corrupts good character." Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning...</p>,
    <p>"Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."</p>,
    <p>The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>,
    <p>But when the kindness and love of God our savior appeared, He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy...</p>,
    <p>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>,
    <p>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.</p>,
    <p>...Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.</p>,
    <p>... I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.</p>,
    <p>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably  more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us...</p>,
    <p>...In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.</p>, <p>All scripture is God-breathed and us useful ... so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>,
    <p>No, In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all  creation, will be able to seperate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord</p>,
    <p>See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!</p>,
    <p>... And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.</p>,
    <p>So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him,...strengthened in faith as you  were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.</p>,
    <p>For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Jesus Christ, who gave himself as a ransom for all people...</p>,
    <p>God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>,
    <p>Jesus...which has become the cornerstone. Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.</p>,
    <p>And I pray that you...may have power, with all the Lord's holy people to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.</p>,
    <p>For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.</p>,
    <p>His divine power has given us everything we need for life and Godliness through our knowledge of Him ...</p>,
    <p>And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered for a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast.</p>,
    <p>Peace I leave you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.</p>,
    <p>With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible</p>,
    <p>I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
