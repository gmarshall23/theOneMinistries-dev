The obvious one is when Jesus returns to begin the Millennial Reign and Satan is bound and we finally get the peace that our heart instinctively longs for. God places in our nature the desire to seek love, peace, kindness, joy as these are the only things that give us true satisfaction. We fight like crazy to get them but only when God is the source of them, do we have true and meaningful peace, etc. The second kingdom that we must pray for is the kingdom in our own heart.

Are you screaming to be heard so as to invoke change as God would want it? We are not here to be meek as believers in the face of wrong. We are to take a shout at abortion, poverty, homelessness, LGBTQ+ laws, school curriculums, etc. because if policy is successful against God's obvious will, word, and desire and we do not shout, then the blame falls on us who knew “right” in the first place.
