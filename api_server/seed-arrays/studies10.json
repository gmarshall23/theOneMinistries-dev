We fight like crazy to get them but only when God is the source of them, do we have true and meaningful peace, etc. The second kingdom that we must pray for is the kingdom in our own heart.

At the end of the day, our lives should reflect these answers and we should also be able to verbalize them based on scripture. So here goes… God is our creator (Gen 1:27) and he created the world through Jesus Christ (Col 1:16). He does not need anything from you or me like false gods, rather, he looks to gift us eternal life and all that we need while living on earth. God is compassionate, merciful, kind, and a God of justice (Ex 34:6-7). He is available to his people and desires that all his people come to know him so that they do not perish (2 Pet 3:9). Knowing God isn't like knowing where the mall is or just saying that he is a being up in Heaven. Knowing him is relational, that is why he sent his son to die for us all (John 3:16). He gave his best and his everything by giving Jesus just so that we could receive grace and a path to know Him, enter into sonship, and spend our days on earth in peace and our eternity with Him in Glory."

Do you ever think that life is not fair, or God is picking on you, or simply that you just cannot catch a break? Quite frankly, all of us do and it makes sense. However, I offer that we should take a step back and consider the before and after. Ephesians 6 tells us that we are caught up in spiritual warfare which means that Satan knows some things that we do not and because of this he declares war on us. You see, if the enemy is attacking that means that he has peaked into your future of faith and service and sees what and how God plans to use you so he is literally trying to destroy you before you can realize and accomplish what God has planned for you. It is just like when Pharoah killed all the babies because of fear and when King Herod killed all the babies because of a similar fear. They both knew that if the babies were allowed to grow and develop that they would likely destroy all they had built. And clearly that did happen through Moses and Jesus. So as you experience the suffering know two things; 1) Satan is attacking because he wants you to fail before you can get started. 2) God will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast (1 Pet 5:10). So rejoice, my friend, the suffering will make you and me strong in the long run and we will be all the more equipped when God reveals his plans for our life."

And it brings out the worst in our character in the sense of lies, deception, cheating, stealing or whatever else we think we need to in order to survive the situation. Smiling faces is a phrase from the 1970s which describes a person in such a dilemma. It literally means that someone like you or me would pretend to be or do something all the while deceiving others in order to get our desired outcome. How often do we do smiling faces with God? We tell him what we think he wants to hear or we act like we are walking according to his will all the while knowing that we are in submission to something else. C'mon, He is God. He already knows…the smile doesn't fool him and we cannot escape reality by pretending. Just like those on the ship, we would fail if we pretend to the Lord. He said to cast your cares on Him(1 Pet 5:7), He said to give Him your burdens, fears, pain, trouble, tribulations, fully knowing that we would have them. He wants this in pure honesty and sincerity so that He can get you through it by his grace, love, and mercy. Notice I said, “get you through” not “remove” it. This is because it is how God grows us and moves us closer to Him. So I do encourage you to smile in the face of challenges because we have a God who cares and will deliver us through the storm. Trust Him, He will hear you and He will answer you."

We are supposed to pray together, play together, mourn together, rejoice together as we are all part of the same body of Christ. So if we notice someone lost along the way, we should literally drop everything and help them find their way back to the Lord and in doing so, we can help them avoid additional challenges that they might otherwise face. In the same way, you and I should also seek prayer and counsel from our brothers and sisters in Christ as we face our own challenges because Satan loves to catch us isolated as he will attempt to deceive, discourage, and distract us from doing the will of God. We are here to work together and as such we are so much stronger as Christ works through us to accomplish God's purpose. Let us look to help our fellow believers. They are not heavy."

So if you are 60 years old that's less than 2 years without issues and a 30 year old doesn't even have a good years worth of a problem free life. So why would God direct us like this? I mean if life is this tough, why am I rejoicing and giving thanks constantly? Well, my friend, it is because we live in the light meaning that Jesus lives in us and therefore we have his strength in our struggle. We do not worry about the darkness and when it will come or what it will bring or how long it will last. And when it does come, and trust me that it will, we thank the Lord for our circumstances. We release it all to him in constant and continual prayer, and we rejoice because nothing can separate us from the love of God through Jesus who lives in us (Rom 8:38-39). It is often said that the struggle is real and I have no argument against that truth, scripture supports that over 150 times with almost 100 of them in the New Testament so I will and I hope you will do as James and count it all joy(Jam 1:2) and do as Peter and cast all your cares on the Lord (1 Pet 5:7) and be confident in the strength that only He can provide."

I decide what I will take from Jesus, Gandhi, Buddha, Mohammad, John Smith and others and make myself spiritual. Well folks, this was tried long ago by the Israelites and Joshua told them, just as I am telling you, there is no plan B. There are no other opinions, no other choices except God and no other way to heaven and salvation except through Jesus. Yes, you and I do get to make a choice as to whom we will serve but if our desire is everlasting life with our creator, we must choose to give our life to the one who gave us life in the first place.

You should never wish to do less.” Paul made this point thousands of years ago when he instructed married couples that they have a duty to each other which is primary. Yet, so often we lead with our own needs and desires that we look to “get” from our spouse rather than looking to “give” to our spouse. This is a formula for a tumultuous relationship. Duty in a spiritual sense means having a servant's heart, taking pride in everything you do, and doing it to the best of our ability. Sublime in this case means of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe. Therefore, in other words, a husband or wife should look to serve their spouse with pride and excellence in every aspect to include their emotions, their time, their body, their possessions, and their services, etc. "

The same goes as we grow more and symbolically have a house of wood meaning our faith is improved, we are not practicing habitual sin but still there are things that keep us from reaching our spiritual potential because our prayer life is lacking and we are not studying the word regularly. God requires our all and our best all the time and He cannot fully give us all that He wants to until we give our all to Him beginning with faith and then exercising said faith in every aspect of our lives. That means complete submission in such a way that we know we can't even take our next breath without the grace of God. So it begins with repentance which is the changing of our mind and going in the opposite direction. This is reliance on God rather than ourselves.

Ultimately, the end game is that we as believers become totally dependent on God for everything to include our next breath and the only way we can get to that level of dependence is to go through things that only God can get us through. The verse personifies this point by acknowledging that we struggle to the point of giving up but also that we have the knowledge that God is our solution. He asks to be taken to the rock that is higher and biblically speaking the rock is God's strength, faithfulness, reliability, and stability all of which are higher than where we are in time of tribulation. There is a song which says, “I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered. That's why I trust Him” That is the key truly.

John is calling out such thinking and behavior and saying that the light is now here and it has overcome such darkness and we as believers need to come into the light. Remember that Jesus represents the light and the truth and the world needs to see what we are doing in light and truth. The world needs to see that Jesus is alive in us because we love him, live for him, and our faith in him allows us to do literally anything that God wills us to do. I love how the Apostle James put it and put himself in it when he said, “...and I will show you my faith by my deeds.” He is saying what you and I need to profess; that if I do not utter one word and I am observed by any and all, the life I live will reflect that Jesus lives in me. I challenge you to intentionally consider all that you do today and before you do it, ask yourself if you would still do it if Jesus were in the same place with you. If yes, do it. If no, pray and don't do it. Lean into your faith that surpasses all knowledge and understanding and do as God leads you. Do as you know what His word says. And spoiler alert, Jesus, in his omnipresence, is with you wherever you are anyhow. Our faith is an amazing gift and has so many aspects that lead us or keeps us in the light and thus pleases God."

I would also offer that the opposite is true, which is that I can do nothing without Him who gives me strength. I would remind both you and me that if we choose to take matters into our own hands, God who gives us free will, will allow it. This means that if you do “it” your way with your skills and desires then you will get your outcome. However, when we submit to the will and influence of the Holy Spirit, we will get the result that God desires. Which do you think will provide the best outcome? Personally, I like to park as the Apostle Paul parks in that all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to his purpose. That means if we do things God's way, it will be done right. You see God calls us, equips us, and sends us in his own timing and process. Yes, this is absolutely tough sometimes to render such submission and patience but again, God is in control and as we mature in our faith we come to realize and accept that God's way is exactly the way it should be."

Let me also remind you that you and I do not have to be one of those people. God has made it clear throughout scripture as to who He is and how much He loves us.

My friend, heaven and hell are real and you and I will spend eternity in one place or the other based on our choices here on earth. My encouragement and prayer is that you will learn who God is and choose to experience Him. The human language is limited in our ability to fully describe Him which is why I use the word experience. If we invite God in He will come and fill you with Himself and that feeling will be everlasting and beyond anything you have ever felt. I personally feel Him everyday and it is so comforting to know that He is in control of my life and therefore all outcomes, whether good or bad, will still benefit me in the long run. Please, I am begging you to choose God and hang out with me in heaven down the road."

There is only ‘life or death' and ‘Jesus or Satan.' To that point, Jesus offers in the same verse that He is here to give life and to give it to the fullest. How cool is that? We get to live on this earth in such a way that nothing can harm us because Jesus is our protector and provider and after this life we get to spend eternity with Him in heaven.

Kids will listen to them eagerly in the developmental years as parents have the luxury, privilege and responsibility to educate them. Studies have shown that kids are most likely to choose to become a Christian between the ages of 8-14 and they will make a choice for the Lord mostly because of how the parents influence and expose them to who God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are. That said, parents please educate your children about the trinity but also share your real life experiences as to what God has done for you so they can learn to trust him and know him on a personal level. They will do as they see. If they see you praise, they will praise. If they hear you sing, they will sing. If they see you pray, they will pray. Let them know that God is still doing miracles everyday for his people and He will do the same for them just as He is doing them in your life. This way we prevent the enemy from stealing their trust by exposing them to drugs, alcohol, the occult, sex or all these other distracting vices when they need help. Remembering who God is and what He does is paramount to sustaining a faith based life and increasing your faith. Finally, I want to expand this concept to all believers because we can share our faith in similar ways and teach all those in our sphere of influence about the goodness and love of God and Jesus Christ."

However, I want you and me to think and remember what scripture tells us and the order in which the instructions are given. Here, in this case it starts with repent. We need to come regularly before the throne seeking forgiveness for any offenses against God or others that we have caused either by thought or activity. Roughly a third of the books in the bible deal with repentance and in all cases the emphasis is that repentance comes before reward. God wants us to be clean in heart and mind, spirit and soul. He wants us to change our mind and go in the other direction away from the sins that offend Him. By the way, that was the definition of repent and once we have sincerely accomplished that task, we walk in the hope and expectation of God's blessings. Understand that God is sovereign and He so often blesses us no matter what state we find ourselves in, yet, He wants his people to acknowledge their shortcomings and to be accountable. So my point is that repentance does not guarantee reward as God is not a genie or a vending machine, it does keep us in his will and makes us right with God."
