If you choose otherwise or have chosen otherwise, He still loves you but you will need to sincerely repent your decision and you will need to ultimately forgive yourself for making that decision as in the example of David's first child with Bathsheba where he needed to repent his sins and ultimately allow God to restore him (Psalms 51 & Psalms 32).

This is fact not conjecture. Losing a loved one is never easy but God is able to do abundantly more than you realize. With that knowledge, I encourage you to use all your emotions in a way that will glorify God. God is Love and love is an action word so put your love into action by giving someone the hug you would have given to your loved one. Make your smile reflect the smile they used to give you. Share your time to help others as you would have helped the one you lost. That is how you can honor them and keep their spirit alive. You will  likely still feel grief at the same time you express love but the expression of love will comfort your grief.

That's great because you are in the right place. I want to start here with a few definitions because in English this word has subtle differences that truly matter. The word 'REPENT' in Hebrew (Old Testament) literally means 'to turn around and return to God as in your behavior'. In Greek (New Testament), 'REPENT' means 'a change of mind that leads to a change in direction towards God.' This is the part that you are responsible for as you are convicted by your actions and want to forever move in a way that leads back to God. Then God says back to us in 1 John that if we repent our sins that he is faithful and just to forgive us. That said, if God has forgiven us then why in the world would you not forgive yourself. It's over!! You cannot have it back, God is bigger than whatever you did and you did not shock or surprise Him when it happened. No matter how bad it was, It is truly over. And assuming you repented from your heart, God will not remember your offense and neither should you. True repentance leaves no residue of regret. Therefore, you have every reason to accept God's forgiveness by forgiving yourself. Everyone falls short, accept it, bury it, and move on. God is waiting for you to return to Him in trust and obedience by changing your mind and heart and separating yourself from the sin(s) that captured you.

Frankly, scripture tells us that we are to forgive because we have been forgiven. It also instructs us to forgive fully, freely and repeatedly. While all this is true, It also makes sense to look through our human lens and point out some of the reasons that we do not forgive, things like: your deep hurt, there was no apology, it might be repeated, revenge, and perhaps even denial that you are hurt in the first place.  There are two main things to bear in mind. First, when you forgive others you relieve yourself of the bad fruits that would otherwise absolutely consume you like bitterness and anger among others. And second, God, in his word, says that when you forgive, you can still desire justice, but leave the justice and vengeance to Him because He alone knows how and when to disperse it. Finally, and super important God said and Jesus also said that when we forgive others, it allows God in heaven to forgive you.

Let me encourage you to replace the  things that tempt you with a sexual outlet or release with things that you can do that garner God's approval as HE God watches your life choices. You must first guard your eyes, then guard your heart, followed by your mind and finally your behavior. That is the slippery slope of this sin if the enemy can discourage, deceive or distract you to let your guard down. The scriptures will guide you to the truth. Seriously, I am insisting that you get into the word. Then surround yourself with good friends who possess good values so you can  help each  other do good things.

Guilt cuts you deep and engenders other feelings like doubt, self-pity and fear among other things. Know this ABSOLUTELY - God does not send guilt - EVER. It is a product of the enemy alone. 1 Peter 5 says that Satan is always looking for someone to devour and 1 Peter 2 says that your sinful desires literally wage war against your soul. Romans 3 says that we all sin and fall short.  So God already knows we are periodically going to fall victim to the flesh and the influence of the enemy. That's why he  sent a savior and a path back through to Him through repentance and faith. Hear me clearly  on this... TRUE REPENTANCE DOES NOT LEAVE A RESIDUE OF GUILT OR REGRET. And not to accept this truth is to waste the life and death of Jesus Christ. Release of guilt is the embodiment of grace itself. This is a fact, not a feeling.

I can't tell you how many times I see someone on TV confess their homosexuality to a huge round of applause. Well, I am sorry to tell you that no one in heaven is clapping. Not one creature or angel and certainly not God our creator or our savior Jesus Christ. Fortunately, scripture is not cultural nor is scripture bound by time. If you are struggling and in need of encouragement, I think it is a good thing in that you have not given in to acceptance that homosexual behavior is normal in the eyes of God. Congratulations on that. My message and encouragement is really one of understanding that you are suffering and you want to get back to better. God calls you to be obedient in a non-emotional way. He asks you to trust in his word, which is why He gave it to you and not to trust in how you feel. The opposite of homosexual behavior is not heterosexual behavior. The opposite of homosexual behavior is morality. Same sex relations, pre-marital relations, any sexual relations outside of marriage according to scripture is sexual immorality and therefore sin in The eyes of the Lord. Scripture says that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance. You are a Christian and therefore righteous and therefore you live by faith. So, my friend, I ask you to put your faith into practice. Having faith means you believe that God has the power to deliver any need. Having trust in God means that you will act on that faith. Though not easy, your faith and trust can and will give you everything necessary. Pray endlessly and earnestly because in this case prayer is your oxygen.

        "quote": "Whether your insecurity comes from your skills, appearance, possessions or some combination of them all; I need you to KNOW that you are the righteousness of God and that makes you complete, necessary, and relevant in God's eyes. That said, you still live and interact with people who want to make you feel less than. Honestly, you will never be able to control other people so I need you to focus on what you can control. God says you are part of his body, God says you are his treasure, God says his grace is sufficient to get you through absolutely anything but you need to believe it, have faith in it and exercise trust in it. Your insecurity is directly and only from the enemy whose tactics are discouragement, distraction and deception. God will not just replace or erase your insecurities, rather you must choose to fight back and to stand in God's truth and take a step in confidence as you trust in God's truth. Please do that right now. Say it out loud that Satan is a liar. Say that you believe God wants the best for you and is ready to give it to you. Finally, Scripture says exactly, 'Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.' Be confident in the Lord, he will get you back to better.",

        "quote": "Understand first of all that your kids love their parents and parents love their kids even though you are having a tough time right now. I encourage you to remind yourself of your role as the parent and if you are a kid please be mindful of your role according to God's word. The first responsibility in either case is to lead with love in all things. Love is kind, gentle, and good so be those things to your child or parent. Be those things first. Next, God says to always leave room for forgiveness. You may be right in every respect but is being right worth your closeness with someone you love so deeply. Find a way to understand, accept, and perhaps even try it from the perspective of each other; meaning mom or dad take a look through your child's lens and remember their challenges and temptations and kids please consider your parents job as it is to protect, guide and provide for you. It is not to be a genie and give you everything you want or to be your best friend.  You might find that the other side is not so bad or you might at least find that there is room for compromise. All that said, there is a biblical hierarchy for parents and kids and nothing I am saying is in contradiction to this principle. If you are a parent, then you need to show leadership. If you are a child, then you need to respect your parents even if you disagree. Jesus is the great mediator here and whatever the issue, it is addressed in His word and His wisdom. Both of you should look up towards God, come close to him and I promise you will see that your problem is smaller than you think or better said, God is bigger than your problem. Resolve things God's way and you both will be better off in the long run.",

        "text": "OBEDIENCE",
        "quote": "In Hebrews, the writer explains that even Jesus himself in the form of man had to learn obedience as a condition of earning the right to be savior in God's eyes. Clearly He did not fail. There is no substitute for obedience and there are many ways you need to understand exactly what obedience is in God's eyes. You also need to understand the opposite of obedience as there is no middle ground in this case. Follow my thinking here as I try to paint a picture in your mind. The case is  OBEDIENCE v DISOBEDIENCE which can be characterized in many ways to include... Belief v Unbelief / God's way v Your Preference / Submission v Refusal / Hard Way v Easy Way / Acceptance v Rebellion / Confirmation v Conviction / Free v Costly and the BIG ONE… Life v Death. Every choice you make will land you on one side or the other and each choice has consequences at God's discretion and timing. Those are the facts. Yet, my friend, my strong encouragement is to be obedient to God's laws first of all which are laid out all throughout scripture. There are no surprises there and know that they exist not to keep you from fun or getting what you want, they exist to keep you from choices and consequences that will never let you obtain fun or what you really want. Then trust in God's will which in very simple terms is to do the next thing he tells you to do. If you will just focus on one decision at a time, seek God's counsel and desire through prayer and knowledge of His word, then nothing but good consequences will come from your good choices. Yes, you will have to sacrifice your preferences at times and yes you, like the rest of us will have challenges, but God knows the outcome and in the end He will only lead you to a great outcome.",

        "quote": "Wow... How hard is it to not hear from God when you have an expectation, emergency, desire or need. I have been there just as many other believers have experienced the same. The challenge is to remember that God is not only sovereign but he is consistent. First off, God is not picking on you or playing with you. He knows your future and has plans for it. Yet, His thinking is not our thinking and His timing is not usually our timing and we have no right or basis to put expectations on our creator. Rather, when God is silent, we must stand on his promises. We must know his word for your situation. Then, talk to Him, tell Him exactly the details of your issues and tell Him that you trust Him more than you trust yourself. Do this with the knowledge that if things are done in your timing you will get your results. If things are done in God's timing you will get God's results. Also, do this with the knowledge that His word says He will do 'abundantly and exceedingly more.' His word says, 'nothing in creation will ever separate you from his Love.' His word says, 'He will never leave you nor forsake you.' From here, my friend, you have to do your job and wait on the Lord with great expectations, because in the fullness of time, God will do mighty things as He accomplishes His purpose through you.",

        "quote": "I bet if we pull back the curtain and have an honest moment, it feels good right? After all, sin is great amusement but I am also guessing that you may be in over your head and you want to stop sinning so willfully or regularly. OK, the fact is that you were born with a sin virus and you will always be drawn to sin if done without repentance and without the renewing of your mind to accomplish God's will, not pleasing your own. It is really as simple as it sounds in concept but it can be difficult in application. If you are still with me, then now we can really get going because your place of failure in sin is your place of recovery upon repentance. I suggest you consider making some hard changes in your environment or your relationships or your habits so that you make room for God. You might need some help along the way so don't be afraid of groups, accountability partners, counseling and church to replace the time you currently spend doing things not of God. Finally, please trust me on this. You need a daily habit of prayer and scripture. Start small but be consistent. God will meet you, I promise. And He will give you everything you need to get past the sinful stage and onto a consistently great walk with Him.",

It is important to know this and it is important to know that I get how bad it feels to suffer. Yet, EVERY Christian MUST suffer if we are going to follow Jesus and of course, Jesus is our model who sacrificed Himself and suffered 16 different ways to the point of death for you and me. However, God wants you to have peace and joy in your suffering because you know the end of the story. God will give you victory whether in this life or the next so nothing else matters. And while in this life, Christ Himself said to be of good cheer for He has overcome the world. So now we gotta find your peace and joy. Pray that God touches you and your situation in a real way as only He can. Ask Him how you can use your suffering to do kingdom work just as the Apostle Paul did in his work? Ask how you can help someone else in spite of your pain? Ask how your testimony about your suffering can bless someone else in a similar situation? I hope you are getting this tactic as I am encouraging you to do a hard pivot from your situation to things God can use regardless of your status. If you shift your focus from victim to victory and service of others in the name of the Lord, I know God will give you all that you need to endure your own circumstances.",

I am writing this as an inmate in prison so clearly I can relate to having a bad day, yet, I don't stay there, I won't stay there and that needs to be your first choice. You need to decide that you will not have sad days. Absolutely, things happen out of your control, someone may hurt you or you may get some bad news; perhaps people purposely or randomly frustrate you; perhaps your circumstances and outcomes simply just don't meet your expectations. God says to expect this first of all, as it is literally part of the human condition. But now you have to listen to what else he says; he says to seek peace in your spirit and pursue it because his ears are attentive to the prayers of the righteous. Then he wants you to remember that Jesus was sad as the world rejected him but you can arm yourself with his same attitude that God can and will overcome all if you exercise faith and trust so that finally, God can finish his good work in you. God has a plan to prosper you but it does mean at times you will go through 'sad' on your way to getting to your harvest. I need you to seriously please hear me on this because God cannot do for you unless you come to agreement with Him that this is the new direction you want to take your thinking and behavior. I need you to make a choice in faith that you will pursue peace, joy, happiness and purpose.

If that is your issue I simply say stop it and remind you that you are part of the body of Christ which means that your work should be useful to help others not take from them. Other ways you may struggle is by being late and therefore not being respectful of others' time. Perhaps, you are not committed to paying your tithes or you are in a position to overcharge people to gain an unfair profit. And please let us not forget that you might have stolen on an emotional level by involving yourself in gossip or slander which steals the otherwise good reputation from another person. No matter what the motivation or intention, it has to stop. I am so glad that you are reading this because it means that you agree and that means that God can forgive you as you confess this to Him and He can strengthen you so that you do not continue with such behavior any longer. You see, we are a community of believers who ultimately will have to give an account and be rewarded for our actions so why not have them be as good as they can be. Look for ways to do for others. Do not be resentful if someone has more and do not look to yourself to satisfy your needs because God is your ultimate provider.

It's the thing that God clearly states in His word that you will not get beyond His capacity to provide relief, assistance and a permanent cure. AAAAHHHHH!!!! I know, it is so darn frustrating. As much as it bugs you, don't be concerned in that way because scripture also says that the enemy will always tempt you and though it can happen anytime, he really likes to hit you with temptation when you are weak or after a nice victory. Literally expect it rather than be shocked by it; thinking you are beyond such things. You have to be on guard and sensitive to those things that tempt you so that you can see them coming and then you must fight back so that they don't overtake you. You will not win long term by simply trying to resist. The enemy's tactics are too good and he is too strong to defeat independently. You must use what God gave you with the same tactics that Jesus used when being tempted by Satan. First prayer and acknowledgement to God that the temptation is real and you do not want to give into it. Then follow up with scripture that counters the temptation. If it is a repeated temptation, you may want to memorize the scripture to be even more prepared. Next, as funny as it sounds, RUN!!! Hurry away from that environment or person who would have you sin. Put distance and keep distance between you and “it” and finally, I strongly suggest that you invite accountability. Alone, the enemy has a huge advantage; but with the help from your fellow believers you are so much stronger. Your spouse, pastor, study leader, friend, professional counselor are among those willing and wanting to support you when you are in need. Allow God to flow help to you through them as you combat the things that tempt you to sin.",

That's your mental anguish, that is where the fight is. Now this won't necessarily be easy but who knows, it might; however, the point is that with things like abuse of drugs and alcohol it is important to replace what you give up, because if you are empty, the enemy will attack with full force to fill that empty even bigger than it was. This challenge is beyond a will-power thing. You gotta share this with someone rooted in the faith. Or join a professional faith based group, or both. That takes strength, resolve and courage but I promise that God will meet you if you will make the effort and He will replace the temporary and amusing result of using drugs and alcohol with a lasting pleasure far better than you could hope for.

The good news is that our God can help and handle and provide relief if you will surrender your pain, fears, and past experiences that have you in your current condition and state of mind. God is faithful and wants you to be free to love others as He loves you. He wants you to pray and praise rather than harass and hit.

Ya, lies can appear to be so simple and so harmless but they are also so far reaching and hurtful. The bible tells us always to be truthful and it even defines Jesus himself as the truth so that we have something to measure against. We are human and it can be hard sometimes to be truthful because truth does have consequences and it may cost you some relationships and some opportunities. But lies also have consequences which usually cost more in the long run outwardly and inwardly and they just erode your spirit and your soul. There is no lie worth all that. The enemy uses lies to convince you that your lies are not so bad but trust me, they are, and once your reputation is corrupted, it can be really difficult to regain it. All this said, let's take the high road which is God's road. It is the one that leads to all things good here on earth and it's ultimately the same road that leads to heaven when all things are said and done.
