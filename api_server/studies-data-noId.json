He does not need anything from you or me like false gods, rather, he looks to gift us eternal life and all that we need while living on earth. God is compassionate, merciful, kind, and a God of justice (Ex 34:6-7). He is available to his people and desires that all his people come to know him so that they do not perish (2 Pet 3:9). Knowing God isn’t like knowing where the mall is or just saying that he is a being up in Heaven. Knowing him is relational, that is why he sent his son to die for us all (John 3:16). He gave his best and his everything by giving Jesus just so that we could receive grace and a path to know Him, enter into sonship, and spend our days on earth in peace and our eternity with Him in Glory."

Do you ever think that life is not fair, or God is picking on you, or simply that you just cannot catch a break? Quite frankly, all of us do and it makes sense. However, I offer that we should take a step back and consider the before and after. Ephesians 6 tells us that we are caught up in spiritual warfare which means that Satan knows some things that we do not and because of this he declares war on us. You see, if the enemy is attacking that means that he has peaked into your future of faith and service and sees what and how God plans to use you so he is literally trying  to destroy you before you can realize and accomplish what God has planned for you. It is just like when Pharoah killed all the babies because of fear and when King Herod killed all the babies because of a similar fear. They both knew that if the babies were allowed to grow and develop that they would likely destroy all they had built. And clearly that did happen through Moses and Jesus. So as you experience the suffering know two things; 1) Satan is attacking because he wants you to fail before you can get started. 2) God will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast (1 Pet 5:10). So rejoice, my friend, the suffering will make you and me strong in the long run and we will be all the more equipped when God reveals his plans for our life."

Smiling faces is a phrase from the 1970s which describes a person in such a dilemma. It literally means that someone like you or me would pretend to be or do something all the while deceiving others in order to get our desired outcome. How often do we do smiling faces with God? We tell him what we think he wants to hear or we act like we are walking according to his will all the while knowing that we are in submission to something else. C’mon, He is God. He already knows…the smile doesn't fool him and we cannot escape reality by pretending. Just like those on the ship, we would fail if we pretend to the Lord. He said to cast your cares on Him("

There are no other opinions, no other choices except God and no other way to heaven and salvation except through Jesus. Yes, you and I do get to make a choice as to whom we will serve but if our desire is everlasting life with our creator, we must choose to give our life to the one who gave us life in the first place.

Yet, so often we lead with our own needs and desires that we look to “get” from our spouse rather than looking to “give” to our spouse. This is a formula for a tumultuous relationship. Duty in a spiritual sense means having a servant’s heart, taking pride in everything you do, and doing it to the best of our ability. Sublime in this case means of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe. Therefore, in other words, a husband or wife should look to serve their spouse with pride and excellence in every aspect to include their emotions, their time, their body, their possessions, and their services, etc. "

The same goes as we grow more and symbolically have a house of wood meaning our faith is improved, we are not practicing habitual sin but still there are things that keep us from reaching our spiritual potential because our prayer life is lacking and we are not studying the word regularly. God requires our all and our best all the time and He cannot fully give us all that He wants to until we give our all to Him beginning with faith and then exercising said faith in every aspect of our lives. That means complete submission in such a way that we know we can’t even take our next breath without the grace of God. So it begins with repentance which is the changing of our mind and going in the opposite direction. This is reliance on God rather than ourselves. Then we lay the foundation for our house of brick by establishing a prayer life and grow by studying the word and win when our faith is tested all the while maintaining a state of joy ("

Remember that Jesus represents the light and the truth and the world needs to see what we are doing in light and truth. The world needs to see that Jesus is alive in us because we love him, live for him, and our faith in him allows us to do literally anything that God wills us to do. I love how the Apostle James put it and put himself in it when he said, “...and I will show you my faith by my deeds.” He is saying what you and I need to profess; that if I do not utter one word and I am observed by any and all, the life I live will reflect that Jesus lives in me. I challenge you to intentionally consider all that you do today and before you do it, ask yourself if you would still do it if Jesus were in the same place with you. If yes, do it. If no, pray and don’t do it. Lean into your faith that surpasses all knowledge and understanding and do as God leads you. Do as you know what His word says. And spoiler alert, Jesus, in his omnipresence, is with you wherever you are anyhow. Our faith is an amazing gift and has so many aspects that lead us or keeps us in the light and thus pleases God."

This means that if you do “it” your way with your skills and desires then you will get your outcome. However, when we submit to the will and influence of the Holy Spirit, we will get the result that God desires. Which do you think will provide the best outcome? Personally, I like to park as the Apostle Paul parks in that all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to his purpose. That means if we do things God’s way, it will be done right. You see God calls us, equips us, and sends us in his own timing and process. Yes, this is absolutely tough sometimes to render such submission and patience but again, God is in control and as we mature in our faith we come to realize and accept that God’s way is exactly the way it should be."

We have to hear this because there is no ‘right or wrong’ or ‘good or bad.’ There is only ‘life or death’ and ‘Jesus or Satan.’ To that point, Jesus offers in the same verse that He is here to give life and to give it to the fullest.

That said, parents please educate your children about the trinity but also share your real life experiences as to what God has done for you so they can learn to trust him and know him on a personal level. They will do as they see. If they see you praise, they will praise.  If they hear you sing, they will sing. If they see you pray, they will pray. Let them know that God is still doing miracles everyday for his people and He will do the same for them just as He is doing them in your life. This way we prevent the enemy from stealing their trust by exposing them to drugs, alcohol, the occult, sex or all these other distracting vices when they need help. Remembering who God is and what He does is paramount to sustaining a faith based life and increasing your faith.

However, I want you and me to think and remember what scripture tells us and the order in which the instructions are given. Here, in this case it starts with repent. We need to come regularly before the throne seeking forgiveness for any offenses against God or others that we have caused either by thought or activity. Roughly a third of the books in the bible deal with repentance and in all cases the emphasis is that repentance comes before reward. God wants us to be clean in heart and mind, spirit and soul. He wants us to change our mind and go in the other direction away from the sins that offend Him. By the way, that was the definition of repent and once we have sincerely accomplished that task, we walk in the hope and expectation of God’s blessings. Understand that God is sovereign and He so often blesses us no matter what state we find ourselves in, yet, He wants his people to acknowledge their shortcomings and to be accountable. So my point is that repentance does not guarantee reward as God is not a genie or a vending machine, it does keep us in his will and makes us right with God."

So as we come to accept Him, love Him and serve Him then He changes our old heart to a new one which is the personification of Jesus. We are literally transformed. Then it becomes our job to protect it at all costs because our heart is our north star and guides us. Our heart ministers to our soul which are our thoughts, emotions, feelings so with a right heart we have right thoughts, emotions and feelings but the opposite is also true and with a wrong heart, we end up with darkness in our thought, emotions, and feelings. Our soul is the harbinger to our outward behavior meaning that we behave exactly as we feel. Be it good and according to the will of God or be it bad and guided by evil. From there our actions have consequences and bla, bla, bla, … you get the rest. God wants us to stay grounded, rooted in the good things that he places in our new heart so that only good will come from us. It really is that simple. Good yields good and it is worth protecting."

Expand this thought to a week, then a month and we can really get into the weeds thinking about everything we will likely face that will cause us fear or discouragement. Things like relationships, family, job, environment, finances, enemies, and health occupy our thoughts on a never ending basis. This is why the verse tells us that God will be with us wherever we are. I spent time in prison and I can testify that in that very dangerous place, God was with me everywhere I was, Hallelujah!! But here is the rub, it takes faith to know this. Belief in this principle, rather promise is necessary because God cannot, will not do anything without faith being at the core. That said, now remember what else the verse says in being strong and courageous. He would not make this a command if life was not going to require it. Think of the things mentioned earlier as our Jordan River; as our Goliath; as our Red Sea. It took strength and courage for the Israelis to face them just as it takes strength and courage to face the day without a job, with disobedient kids, with an addiction but I say again, God is with us faithfully wherever we are, never to leave or forsake us ("

That is our mission plain and simply stated. Yet, in performing our mission there are those who will just not accept the truth for reasons like science, pluralism, apathy and others and we have to accept this reality.

Acknowledge His holiness and power and that we revere Him. 3. Express our desire to be with Him in Heaven and that we eagerly await Jesus’ return. 4. Ask for our necessary provisions to get through the day and not beyond it. 5. Ask sincerely to be forgiven for any offenses we have committed and at the same time, ask for the strength to forgive anyone who may have offended us. 6.

On another note, think of how many times Jesus prayed to God. The apostle Paul says it best when he says to pray always, pray without ceasing. We should consult God in all that we do and thank Him for all that He does without neglecting what we may consider the little things. We cannot even take our next breath without the grace of God. "

His name, just His name gives us complete access to resurrection power. Specifically, you and I get to say to God, “Father, in the name of Jesus please take my suffering, my pain, my iniquity, my transgressions, my oppression, my judgement” and anything else that challenges us. In return, God says to us, “Because of Jesus, I will take it all and let me give you forgiveness, healing, salvation, rewards, righteousness and peace.” How cool is that? And did I mention that this is a lifetime guarantee, a full warranty on anything broken inside us including all our sins that we commit.

The Christian Church began in Jerusalem after the ascension with 12 apostles and some disciples very small just like a mustard seed. God blessed the movement with his divine power and today, though not the largest, it is the only religion that is everywhere in the world. Symbolically, the mustard seed starts small but grows its branches large enough to provide refuge and shelter to the birds. Similarly, by divine power, the Kingdom of God expands through God’s work in people's lives. Our faith begins small and through the process which includes prayer, study, transgression, temptation, wins, losses, etc. we increase our faith and maturity and gain closeness with God while becoming more like Jesus. We, in essence, are like the seed that grows into a strong tree and are now able to support others to help them grow as well as provide shelter or refuge when needed ("

We should do this more with scripture because scripture often speaks to just one side of the equation and it is up to us to remember to analyse  the other side because sometimes that is where the emphasis belongs. I think this to be true in the case of this verse. “Walk through the valley” means that we will be in the presence of a trial, tribulation, or challenge. Yet, I submit that if we are in a valley, it can only be so if there are mountains on either side. The mountains define the presence of solace and refuge where God dwells ("

And let’s not forget the random, one time, things that pop up literally every day like road rage, a call from your kids school, a chance argument that you did not see coming. That is everyday life and God understands that we encounter such things on a regular basis. This is why His instruction translates to being careful and intentional about how we conduct ourselves in the presence of God as His representatives. Most of us are not fortunate enough to be able to dictate our environment completely which means we have to take life as it comes, yet as believers we always need to maintain an awe or reverence for what being a believer means and how it looks to others and more importantly how it looks to God. V:13 says that God works in us to do His purpose so how can that happen if we do not humble ourselves and allow His spirit to guide us accordingly with the importance and seriousness that each and every situation deserves? So ya, we have to grind a bit but it is a peaceful, purposeful, and possible grind as God is guiding us every step of the way. In doing so we most certainly will reach that purpose without leaving baggage and bad fruit along the way."

We must be intentional about making it a part of our DNA so that we cannot have outward behavior that reflects otherwise. Let’s work this backwards for a minute… from a biblical perspective, our outward behavior is controlled by our thoughts, feelings and emotions. This means that we act as we think and feel so when happy we show it outwardly and when not happy that shows outwardly also. Therefore, our soul, which is our thoughts, feelings and emotions, dictate our actions or outward behavior. So what influences our soul? I’m glad you asked. We are spirit, with a soul, housed in a body. Our spirit is what is changed by God when we accept Christ as our personal savior. We are literally  born again in spirit ("

All that said, back to the main point of letting our lives show that we are saved or born again at all times, not just when we want to appear holy. The Apostle Matthew just said it here in chapter 3. The Apostle James says it in chapter 1. And the Apostle Paul says it many times like in Ephesians 4. God wants our lives to be a shining example, the light on a hill, to show the world who He is and what everyone has access to if they seek Him and let Him change them just as He did for you and me. It doesn’t take words, but rather a willingness to let our actions reflect the righteous person that we have become in Christ."
